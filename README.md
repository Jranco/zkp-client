# ZKP prover

An iOS package implementing the prover side of a zero-knowledge verification scheme.
The goal is to have a white-label solution in terms of the selected ZKP scheme, providing an abstract infrastructure agnostic to the selected implementation.
At the moment only the interactive, Feige-Fiat-Shamir flavor of the ZKP is supported.
